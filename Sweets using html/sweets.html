        <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <P class="hea">Tirunelveli Halwa: Tamil Nadu's Legendary Red Wheat Halwa You Need to Try
Most of my childhood Diwali memories usually revolve around food. Back then most Diwali sweets were home-made. I remember my mother also making sweets that were specifically for 'distribution' only. Sweets that were equally tasty yet not labour intensive that would be shared with the neighbours. I would make a push for wheat halwa to be packed in the sweet boxes meant for our neighbours. It was one of the only sweets that I would be happy to share back then; that hasn't changed after all these years.</P>
